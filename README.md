QuickDBD

## Overview of the Analysis: With this weeks module, I was asked to delve into the porgramming language of SQL. While more niche, and therefore less broad in scope than Python, SQL is especially pertinent when dealing with relational databases. Relational databases are one such quality of this weeks module because we are dealing with a wide range of tables that share columns of data. I first used QuickDBD to give a data visualization of 6 tables of data (Departments, Employees, Salaries, Managers, Dept_Emp, Titles). From here, I established each of these tables in PgAdmin4 using the Query Editor and then importing the provided csv files for each. Upon completion of this, I then was able to start formulating more complex tables between the shared data of the tables, such as Employee Count by Department Number, number of employees retiring, etc. The aforementioned steps bring me to the Module Challenge. Here we are being asked to determine the number of retiring employees per title, as well as identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. I will do this through the use of already existing tables as well as creating new tables to ascertain these requests by Bobby's manager.
